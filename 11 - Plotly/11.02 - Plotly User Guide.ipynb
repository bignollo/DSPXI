To show markers and\n            text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure\n            to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below\n            traces*.\n        connectgaps\n            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing\n            values) in the provided data arrays are connected.\n        customdata\n            Assigns extra data each datum.

Defaults to\n            \"none\" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets\n            \"tonexty\" (\"tonextx\") if `orientation` is \"v\" (\"h\") Use\n            with `fillcolor` if not \"none\". \"tozerox\" and \"tozeroy\"\n            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. \"tonextx\" and\n            \"tonexty\" fill between the endpoints of this trace and\n            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those\n            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area\n            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave\n            like \"tozerox\" and \"tozeroy\". \"toself\" connects the\n            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if\n            it has gaps) into a closed shape. \"tonext\" fills the\n            space between two traces if one completely encloses the\n            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like\n            \"toself\" if there is no trace before it. \"tonext\"\n            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the\n            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or\n            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With\n            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some\n            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,\n            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing\n            order.\n        fillcolor\n            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent\n            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line\n            color, whichever is available.\n        groupnorm\n            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the\n            first `groupnorm` found in the `stackgroup` will be\n            used - including if `visible` is \"legendonly\" but not\n            if it is `false`. Sets the normalization for the sum of\n            this `stackgroup`. With \"fraction\", the value of each\n            trace at each location is divided by the sum of all\n            trace values at that location. \"percent\" is the same\n            but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are\n            multiple subplots, or multiple `stackgroup`s on one\n            subplot, each will be normalized within its own set.\n        hoverinfo\n            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If\n            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed\n            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover\n            events are still fired.\n        hoverinfosrc\n            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .\n        hoverlabel\n            plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Hoverlabel instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        hoveron\n            Do the hover effects highlight individual points\n            (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled\n            regions? If the fill is \"toself\" or \"tonext\" and there\n            are no markers or text, then the default is \"fills\",\n            otherwise it is \"points\".\n        hovertemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information that\n            appear on hover box. Note that this will override\n            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\". See https://github.com/d3/d3-format\n            /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the\n            formatting syntax. The variables available in\n            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data\n            described at this link\n            https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.\n            Additionally, every attributes that can be specified\n            per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are\n            available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is\n            displayed in the secondary box, for example\n            \"<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>\". To hide the secondary\n            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.\n        hovertemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate\n            .\n        hovertext\n            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)\n            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over\n            all the data points. If an array of string, the items\n            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)\n            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain\n            a \"text\" flag.\n        hovertextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .\n        ids\n            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object\n            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an\n            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.\n        idssrc\n            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .\n        legendgroup\n            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of\n            the same legend group hide/show at the same time when\n            toggling legend items.\n        line\n            plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Line instance or dict with\n            compatible properties\n        marker\n            plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Marker instance or dict with\n            compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .\n        mode\n            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If\n            the provided `mode` includes \"text\" then the `text`\n            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the\n            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than\n            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default\n            is \"lines+markers\". Otherwise, \"lines\".\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        orientation\n            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the\n            first `orientation` found in the `stackgroup` will be\n            used - including if `visible` is \"legendonly\" but not\n            if it is `false`. Sets the stacking direction. With \"v\"\n            (\"h\"), the y (x) values of subsequent traces are added.\n            Also affects the default value of `fill`.\n        r\n            r coordinates in scatter traces are deprecated!Please\n            switch to the \"scatterpolar\" trace type.Sets the radial\n            coordinatesfor legacy polar chart only.\n        rsrc\n            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  r .\n        selected\n            plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Selected instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        selectedpoints\n            Array containing integer indices of selected points.\n            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.\n            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where\n            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,\n            any other non-array values means no selection all where\n            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        stackgaps\n            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the\n            first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be\n            used - including if `visible` is \"legendonly\" but not\n            if it is `false`. Determines how we handle locations at\n            which other traces in this group have data but this one\n            does not. With *infer zero* we insert a zero at these\n            locations. With \"interpolate\" we linearly interpolate\n            between existing values, and extrapolate a constant\n            beyond the existing values.\n        stackgroup\n            Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the\n            same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or\n            their x values if `orientation` is \"h\"). If blank or\n            omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also\n            turns `fill` on by default, using \"tonexty\" (\"tonextx\")\n            if `orientation` is \"h\" (\"v\") and sets the default\n            `mode` to \"lines\" irrespective of point count. You can\n            only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in\n            a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)\n            other traces in the same group. With multiple\n            `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if\n            fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the\n            later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.\n        stream\n            plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Stream instance or dict with\n            compatible properties\n        t\n            t coordinates in scatter traces are deprecated!Please\n            switch to the \"scatterpolar\" trace type.Sets the\n            angular coordinatesfor legacy polar chart only.\n        text\n            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If\n            a single string, the same string appears over all the\n            data points. If an array of string, the items are\n            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.\n            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a \"text\" flag and\n            \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textfont\n            Sets the text font.\n        textposition\n            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects\n            to the (x,y) coordinates.\n        textpositionsrc\n            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition\n            .\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .\n        tsrc\n            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  t .\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Unselected instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x\n            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting\n            coordinate and `dx` the step.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If \"x2\", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xcalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.\n        xsrc\n            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .\n        y\n            Sets the y coordinates.\n        y0\n            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y\n            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting\n            coordinate and `dy` the step.\n        yaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian y axis. If \"y\" (the default value), the\n            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If \"y2\", the y\n            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.\n        ycalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.\n        ysrc\n            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .\n        ",

With \"interpolate\" we linearly interpolate\n            between existing values, and extrapolate a constant\n            beyond the existing values.\n        stackgroup\n            Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the\n            same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or\n            their x values if `orientation` is \"h\"). If blank or\n            omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also\n            turns `fill` on by default, using \"tonexty\" (\"tonextx\")\n            if `orientation` is \"h\" (\"v\") and sets the default\n            `mode` to \"lines\" irrespective of point count.

With multiple\n            `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if\n            fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the\n            later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.\n        stream\n            plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Stream instance or dict with\n            compatible properties\n        t\n            t coordinates in scatter traces are deprecated!Please\n            switch to the \"scatterpolar\" trace type.Sets the\n            angular coordinatesfor legacy polar chart only.\n        text\n            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair.

Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Unselected instance or dict\n            with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`.

In addition it also provides details on the possible parameters that are available to change in the `Layout` object as well.\n",
